This may sound complex and tedious, but doing this gives way to a scala of automations. With this vision in mind, we started a big new project at the beginning of 2018: the Configurator.

However, for this to be used by actual consumers, the exports need to be served using an API. One of the big problems here is that Revit is too unstable to serve as a cog in a enterprise application. That is why we wrote a custom wrapper around Revit; a program that keeps Revit alive and communicates with our cloud system.
