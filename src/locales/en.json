Revit can be a bit unreliable at times,\n which posed a threat to ensuring we can go from a manual process to a fully automated cloud version.\nWe wrote a program that plugs into the existing application, enabling us to imitate user interactions with code. \nThis allows us to automate complex actions flawlessly. \nUsing the program, we create an output within Revit, for example a PDF with the building plans.\n This pdf is then uploaded to the cloud, and its location is passed to the central server.
