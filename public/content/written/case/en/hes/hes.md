      # From Excel sheet to Enterprise Application

      ### The Problem


      HES is one of Europeâ€™s biggest multinationals when it comes to bulk transport, processing, blending and storage. For one of the Oil Terminals (Hartel Tank Terminal) at the Maasvlakte in Rotterdam, all of the planning, status and speficiations of the different steel parts were processed in a single Excel sheet, spanning more than 30.000 lines. This results in a bigger chance of errors, and makes it very hard to conclude anything based on the dataset in reference to the project status

      ### The solution


      The solution we provided consisted of three main parts:


      <br/>


      <br/>


      The Database: Using code, we parsed the Excel sheet and structured the data using a model that separates the tank terminals. This all runs in a Spring Boot Java environment, with data storage in SQL.


      <br/>


      <br/>


      The API: Next, all actions that can result in a change in data were analysed and grouped in different business rules. For each of these rules, an API call was created, so that a construction worker can find a specific tank part by searching for terminal number, tank number and a list of available parts. The application tracks who makes the edits for safety purposes. The application can then be used to check-in a specific part at a checkpoint in the process. The application contains a overview of the status of all of the elements, relieving the administrative workers from a repetitive task, and shifts the responsibility for keeping the data up to date to the workers that are responsible for that specific part.

      <br/>


      The Insights: Because the data set is so large, it is hard to see what the status of the whole project is at a glance. That is why our BI expert set up a PowerBI dashboard. This dashboard highlights all kinds of key values, aimed towards management. Management can see delays in Planned vs. Actuals, how much steel is at what point in the process and what the status is of each terminal. This all results in an automated process of rapporting, saving human hours. Management gets a real time insight of the status of the whole project.

      ### The Conclusion


      By investing in custom built software that is adapted to the current work flow, a tool was developed that saves the time of the company employees, improves data security, shifts responsibilities to the right people and has given management new insights in the status of the project.
