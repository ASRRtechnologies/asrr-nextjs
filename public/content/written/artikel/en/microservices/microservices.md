      # Can microservices save you time and effort?


      ## Using microservice architecture in software can provide various advantages over traditional monolithic applications.


      &nbsp;

      ### How using microservices can make your applications a lot more flexible


      Think of classical software as a very large cruise ship. It’s a very complex and big machine, capable of a lot of different things. However, it’s a large endeavor to build from scratch, and if one part breaks, the whole ship might sink. Furthermore, it’s a hassle to upgrade one specific part, even though the rest may be working fine.

      Microservices are like a fleet of smaller, more specialized boats. One focusses on payments, the next on user management, another one for security, etc. It’s easy to swap a single boat if it breaks. It’s easy to isolate a single part if it needs to be upgraded, and can be over-engineered as it is used extensively through different projects.
